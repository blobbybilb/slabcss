# SlabCSS

#### A tiny CSS framework* with a unique look (WIP)

## About

Someone once said:

> if you make a good looking serif based framework <br> ill [sic] do my equivalent of "ill eat my hat" [sic]

The result, later:
> "oh god its [sic] actually uniquely good" - that person

<br>

It's not really framework, just a collection of CSS styles for semantic HTML

## Usage

Add this to your HTML:
```html
<style>
  @import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blobbybilb/slabcss/main/style.css");
</style>
```
And HTML as usual. The styles are applied to semantic HTML elements.
